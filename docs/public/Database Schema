Data That needs to be stored:
-Crowd sourced Submission 
  -Submission ID
  -Type of hazard
  -Location
  -Data and time it was reported
  -Severity of hazard
  -Description of Hazard

- Hazard Data (We could also seperate the Submitted hazard data and the device detected hazard data depending on how we want to display it)
  -Hazard ID
  -Submission ID if it was submitted
  -Device ID IF it was from a device
  -Location? (I dont know if it would be best to store that data here too or use the IDs to connect to the other data sets and grab the location data from there)
  -Hazard Type? (Same situation as Location)

-User Data (If we allow users such as government workers to view the specific data or users need to create an account to submit hazard inforamtion)
  -User ID
  -Username
  -First name
  -Last Name
  -Date Joined
  -Role (could contain roles for if they are a regular user, goverment worker, Admin Account, etc.)

-Device Data (Once the ECE team has the device made and a way for it to detect and send data)
  -Device ID
  -Location of Device
  -Hazardtype
  -Times the device has been activated (Probably best to have this connect to another dataset to store specific times that the sensor has gone off)
